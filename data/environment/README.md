Rasters projected using --- over entire globe with 0.5 km(?) resolution 

Parameters are from the mean depth layer - using the average depth of each 0.5 grid square

Data in .nc files is the average value of:
- Temperature
- Salinity
- many others

[tif_files.R] converts .nc files to GeoTIFF files - used in sdm course so familiar with this format

## Still to do
- need to decide on extent based on sponges
- clip rasters to this extent

  Then I think (??) we're good to go - but definitely double check this...
